FOR PACISE RESEARCH PAPER REVIEWES

Slight changes were made to the source code during testing.
This class based on some static constexpr int BC_CPU_SINGLE_THREAD_THRESHOLD 
determines if the class utilizes a single thread copy or a multi-threaded copy.

For the research paper submitted I removed this threshold to ensure all copies were multithreaded. 
For single threaded version I simply re-compiled without -fopenmp.

To replicate these results, go to

BC_Internals/BC_Mathlibraries/Mathematic_CPU.h

go to method:

---------------------------------------------

template<typename T, typename J>
static void copy(T t, const J j, int sz) {
		if (sz < BC_CPU_SINGLE_THREAD_THRESHOLD) {
			copy_single_thread(t, j, sz);
			return;
		}
#pragma omp parallel for
		for (int i = 0; i < sz; ++i) {
			t[i] = j[i];
		}
#pragma omp barrier
	}

---------------------------------------------

and remove the entire if statement.
